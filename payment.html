	<!--
	 Idea:
	 For each of the items that were in the order, 
	 	create an element for it, that has an image, and the price total
	 	give it an attribute called draggable and set it to true
	 	put all of the draggable items in the first box
	 	have a button for adding new order pay boxes
		then allow dragging between boxes:

		 	then do something like this:
		 	function drag(ev) {
			    ev.dataTransfer.setData("text", ev.target.id);
			}
			follow the instructions here:
			https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_draganddrop.asp

		then, when a draggable object is released, must recalculate price totals for all boxes
